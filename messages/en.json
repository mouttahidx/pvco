Now I can sit on the porch at the cottage 9 months of the year. if its hot, I easily open them from top to bottom, or , bottom to top. I can control the breeze or driving rain in seconds. They pop out for cleaning, the grand kids can't break them. Just to much to say that is all positive. Thanks Sunspace and your very helpful staff.",

    "2_text": "Sunspace Modular Enclosures began modestly in 1991. In those early start-up days, the owners went to the client’s project site, measured their deck and drew the design of the Sunroom by hand. They would cut and assemble all the parts and install the Sunrooms themselves.<br /><br />While perfecting the craft of designing, building, assembling and installing beautiful indoor/outdoor living spaces, Sunspace dedicated a lot of time and effort to research and development. Their goal was to engineer the highest quality product while establishing the most efficient manufacturing process. This dedication to bringing consumers the highest quality product at affordable prices paid off and in 1997 Sunspace expanded to take on Independent business Authorized Dealers to promote and sell their products across Canada and the United States. We pride ourselves on providing tremendous support to our Dealers.<br /><br />The overwhelming demand for Sunspace products prompted us to relocate our manufacturing facilities in 2006 to Newcastle Ontario, into what has grown to be an over 150,000 square foot facility. This expansion allowed us to bring more of the manufacturing process in house, drastically reducing the time it takes to build a Sunroom and ensure the highest level of quality in our products.<br /><br />The demand for Sunspace products continues to grow and our team continues growing to meet it. Isn’t it interesting that the price of a Sunspace sunroom has increased only slightly over the last 20 years, providing more and more homeowners with options to comfortably add to their living space! Sunspace Dealers and their Teams of Factory Trained Installers have designed and built millions of square feet worth of indoor/outdoor living spaces for their customers to enjoy year after year.<br /><br />Contact Sunspace Sunrooms today to get started on bringing your dreams to life with an indoor/outdoor living space customized to suit your property. That’s luxury you deserve.",

Thanks to innovation in the materials used, the frames today are smaller, yet still very strong.And because the doors fold, they take a lot less space when opened.<br/><br/>This allows them to open up an entire wall, which isn't really possible with sliding patio doors. The doors neatly fold away to the edge of the frame. Your home will benefit from maximum visibility and unmatched convenient garden access.<br /><br /><h3 style='color:#201c50;font-weight:bold'>Add value to your home</h3>It's always nice to know that your home increase in value over time, even if you don't plan on selling it. It's certainly something to consider when planning your next home renovation project.<br /><br />Bi-folding doors can fit any style house, from old Victorian homes to modern, even minimal, home styles that have become so popular these days. Their simplicity and practicality can enhance the way you live at home. Bi-folding doors brighten up dark spaces and create seamless access to your garden, blending the inside with the outside.<br /><br /><h3 style='color:#201c50;font-weight:bold'>Allow for more natural light</h3>Due to their slim frame profile, the window surface is a lot larger, meaning they allow far more light into the room than any other window or door. Even when closed there's little in the way of light, so there isn't really a compromise. And obviously when opened the space is astounding, with nothing obstructing natural daylight.<br /><br />Bi-folding doors can be perfect for rooms that don't get much light, rooms which you'd like to enjoy more time in.<br /><br /><h3 style='color:#201c50;font-weight:bold'>Low maintenance but highly durable</h3>Bi-folding doors, especially the ones made of aluminium, can withstand temperature changes throughout the year. Neither the cold nor the hot weather can warp or bend the frames. Bi-folding doors are highly thermally efficient and can withstand strong gust of wind as well.<br /><br />And all that doesn't come at a cost, because folding doors are easy to maintain. Their lifespan can be prolonged by just simple occasional wash down and a dash of oil.<br /><br /><h3 style='color:#201c50;font-weight:bold'>Superior security and safety</h3>Although bi-folds may seem fragile and not very strong due to the fact they literally replace a brick wall with glass, they are very secure. So much so, that bi-folds are widely used by businesses in commercial environments.<br /><br />The security elements which they have include multi-point locks, robust frames secure with heavy duty hinges, and in some cases, laminated triple glazed glass. The glass is tougher to break and the doors can't be levered off the hinges. All that makes break ins very difficult and is likely to put off burglars.",
